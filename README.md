Webapp Boilerplate
==================================

This project works as basic structure to build a webapp.
Using:

- Phonegap / Cordova ( to make the build on the desired devices Android or iOS)
- Angular as dependency manager and router
- Ionic (UI)
- Grunt (as task manager)
- Karma / Jasmine / PhantomJS (test)

For icons implementation I recommend to use svg, so Grunt svgmin its added to package json.
Also its added htmlmin cssmin package to minify the SASS generated styles and html templates.

## Setup 

As always: npm install and bower install to get the Bower and Node modules declared on package.json and bower.json
Also you need to download the Cordova desired platforms manually.
